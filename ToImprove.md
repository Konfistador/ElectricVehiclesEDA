# General documentation, providing more view on what canb be added to the EDA data.

## 1. Study more about the distribution of variables
Currently, we both have some decent results on the Covariaton between the different variables. At the smae time, we both are missing findings on their distribution. This is what I am going to add as a starter to the Knitted Doc

- [ ] Add Distribution visualisations.
- [ ] Make conclusions out of the above.

## 2. Validate the findings
It's good to have some results, but the same should be validated, so that we are not presenting findings and information, that is not according to truth

- [ ] Validate the Findings. 

## 3. Write a General conclusion
When the above are completed, a general conclusion would be useful, as the same can briefly describe our findings up to this moment.

- [ ] Results concluded and summarized.
