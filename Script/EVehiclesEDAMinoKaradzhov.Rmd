## Setup
```{r}
evData <- read.csv("../Dataset/ElectricCarData_Clean_Me.csv")
library(tidyverse)
```
```{r}
evData
```

# Do Vehicles with RapidCharge Accelerate different than the ones without ?
### It appears they actually do! Unforntunately we do not have data on the weight of the vehicle, otherwise we could've investigated futher.
```{r}
evData %>%
ggplot(mapping = aes(x = RapidCharge, y = AccelSec)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
```{r}
mean_RapidChargeAccel <- evData %>%
  filter(RapidCharge == "Yes") %>%
  mean(AccelSec)
```
```{r}
mean_nonRapidChargeAccel <- evData %>%
  filter(RapidCharge == "No") %>%
  mean(AccelSec)
```



##What is the number of RapidCharge Vehicles?
### It appears that the vast majority of Vehicles have RapidCharge. Could it be that we are getting the data above, simply because there are more datapoints in one of the sub-categories?
```{r}
evData %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = RapidCharge)) +
  geom_bar()
```
#Do vehicles with certain plug type have the highest range?
```{r}
evData %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x= PlugType, y = Range_Km)) +
  geom_point() + geom_smooth()
```
# Do vehicles with certain powertrain accelerate faster?
```{r}
evData %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x = PowerTrain, y = AccelSec)) +
  geom_boxplot()
```
##What is the distribution of this categorical variable?
```{r}
evData %>%
  ggplot(mapping = aes(x=PowerTrain)) +
  geom_bar()
```
